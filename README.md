# `rid` cross platform
Joke command for a command line. Prints out sarcastic messages whenever you incorrectly type `dir`. Think of it as an homage to [`sl`](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) but for Windows. (even though it's cross platform now)

Unlike the [original](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/rid-dotnet) `rid` which is written in C# for .NET Framework, this is rewritten in C++, so that it can be compiled for basically anything. Changes in program behaviour (i.e., new messages, changed messages, different method of providing messages) will be synced with the .NET original.

I will not provide compiled binaries for this version of `rid` -- you are encouraged to compile it yourself. [Check the .NET version for Windows binaries of that version.](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/rid-dotnet/releases/tag/release)
